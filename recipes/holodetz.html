        <p> Russian Holodets is a cold meat jelly, traditionally made in Russia for the holiday table. 
             This Russian Holodets recipe is a very authentic Russian recipe that has been around for centuries.

            <li>1 lb boneless meat (any kind of meat, for example chicken thighs)</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Onion</li>

            <li>1/8 tsp pepper</li>

            <li>2 bay leaves</li>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="title sub">Steps</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Put all the meat, whole onion, salt and pepper in a large pot. Add enough water to completely cover the meat plus an extra inch of water on top of the meat. </li>
            
            <li>Bring water to a boil and skim off the foam. </li>

            <li>   Reduce heat to simmer, cover and simmer for 3 hours.</li>

            <li>Add the bay leaves and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>

            <li>Remove all the meat from the pot.</li>

             <li>Discard the onion and bay leaves. </li>

            <li>Pull the meat away from the bones and discard the bones. </li>

            <li>Chop all the meat and put on the bottom of an 8Ã—12 dish (you can use Pyrex dish). </li>

             <li>Strain the cooking liquid through the cheesecloth. </li>

            <li> If you were using chicken legs instead of feet, you need to add the gelatin to the liquid. Add 3 grams of gelatine for each cup of the liquid and mix thoroughly. </li>

             <li>Pour the liquid over the chopped meat.  </li>

             <li>Refrigerate the dish with Holodets overnight. </li>

            <li>Cut Holodets into squares and serve with horseradish or mustard.</li>

        </ol>
